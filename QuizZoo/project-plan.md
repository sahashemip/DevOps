## Project Plan:

Meanwhile, please find below the home assignment. Please send your answer within one week from now. Please focus on quality, testing (unit testing, functional testing, end to end testing ...etc.)


Imagine that you are a fullstack developer tasked to create a **quiz app**. Your first task is to create a simple first version of the app that consists of a mobile app for answering the quiz, a backend API that stores answers to a database and a web ui that shows a summary of the results.

The mobile app should contain two views:
a landing page that is shown when app is started, displays a welcome text and has a button that will lead user to the second page
a form that contains one free text input, one question with three options (only one can be chosen), a button to submit the answers and a button to move back to the landing page. When answers are sent, the user is moved back to the landing page.

The backend API should provide the possibility to store quiz answers and list results. Results should be stored in a database.
The web ui should show a listing that displays on every line a date and time when an answer was submitted, which option was chosen and 10 first characters of the free text answer, if the answer is longer, show 7 first characters and three dots in the end.
As this is the first iteration of the project, you don’t need to deploy the solution to app stores or have it running and available on the internet or have it ready for production. You should however be able to demonstrate all the parts eg. from your local computer/laptop and be able to walk through the codebase with us.

Even though this is an early version, it doesn’t mean it should be low quality. Be ready to discuss what compromises there might be in your implementation and what would be needed before the solution would be ready for production.

Please store your code in github. 
Technology to be used: react, react native and node.js
